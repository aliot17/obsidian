### Analysis

Overview
	The Introduction of this paper is slightly under 1,5 pages long. 
	Its 'full length is solely dedicated to the WhatsApp messenger, it's ubiquity and features, as well as its' importance in Israeli society. One sentence of the second paragraph mention data privacy issues as "not free of controversy". Two more sentences of the next paragraph describe the previous study dedicated to privacy concerns in usage of WhatsApp in association with the COVID-19 pandemic. the section doesn't touch on the research topic, questions, methodologies or conclusions and does not provide any guidance for the reader.
- Understandability
	The section is written in a sightly ponderous, obfuscated language. It doesn't have a clear or logical structure and does not expand on the abstract. It contains multiple references to substantiate the claims that are otherwise not in-line with the stated scope of the paper. it is understandable, yet seems unnecessary
- Positioning
	Section does not talk about the scope of the study at all. It provides some background on the platform used in the study, but almost ignores the topic.
- Problem
	The problem is hinted in a couple of sentences, however the continuation of the paragraphs outweighs and distracts from it. research questions are not mentioned in the section.
- Solution
	As with the problem, neither solution, nor methods, outcomes or conclusions are mentioned in the introduction.
	The section does not provide any information on the further structure of the paper.
