* **[[Phishing and Social Engineering]]** Tactics commonly used to deceive users into divulging sensitive information, such as login credentials, or to trick them into installing malicious software that can compromise their device and messaging accounts. [98, 105]

* **[[Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks]]** Attacks where an adversary intercepts communications between two parties without their knowledge, potentially allowing the attacker to eavesdrop on messages or manipulate the key exchange process in encrypted communications. [106]

* **[[Software Vulnerabilities]]** Weaknesses or bugs in messaging applications or their underlying protocols that can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts, devices, or message content. [90]

* **[[Side-Channel Attacks]]** Attacks that aim to extract cryptographic keys or other sensitive information by analyzing patterns in the application's behavior, such as power consumption or processing time. [8]

* **[[Zero-Click Exploits]]** Attacks that require no user interaction to compromise a device, often delivering spyware to silently monitor user activity. These have been successfully used against vulnerabilities in iMessage and WhatsApp. [89, 90]

* **[[Linked Devices Exploitation]]** Attacks that abuse the "linked devices" feature in popular apps like Signal and WhatsApp, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access to accounts by tricking users into scanning malicious QR codes. [97, 99, 100]

* **[[Botnets]]** Networks of compromised computers or devices controlled by a single attacker, which can be used to disseminate spam messages, distribute malware, and spread phishing links to a large number of users via messaging platforms. They can also be used to automate the creation of numerous fake accounts within messaging apps, enabling coordinated malicious activities. [21]

* **[[Metadata Leaks]]** The inadvertent or deliberate exposure of metadata associated with messaging, which can reveal highly sensitive information about users' relationships, daily routines, habits, and locations, even when the content of a message is protected by strong encryption. [8, 80]

* **[[Government Surveillance]]** Efforts by government agencies to access encrypted communications, creating a tension between national security interests and individual privacy rights. [14]
	* * **[[Pegasus Spyware]]** A sophisticated spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group, capable of being covertly installed on mobile phones without any user interaction through "zero-click" exploits. Once installed, it can monitor calls, capture text messages, track location, and collect passwords, photos, and other data, effectively turning a smartphone into a surveillance device. [132, 133, 134]

* **[[Traffic Analysis]]** A technique used to infer information from patterns in encrypted traffic, potentially revealing details about who is communicating and when, even if the content remains hidden. [9]

* **[[Compromised-Friend Attacks]]** Attacks where adversaries leverage relationships within a user's social network to infer metadata about conversations between honest users. [91]

* **[[AI-Based Information Extraction]]** The use of artificial intelligence technologies to collect and analyze user data from messaging applications, potentially exposing sensitive information without explicit user consent or understanding. AI models often require access to personal data to function effectively, which can lead to unintentional data collection and processing. [161, 170]
