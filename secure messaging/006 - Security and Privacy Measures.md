- **[[Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)]]** A security measure that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account, adding an additional layer of security and making it more difficult for unauthorized individuals to gain access even if they have obtained a password. [78]

* **[[Disappearing Messages]]** A feature offered by messaging applications that automatically deletes messages after a specified duration, enhancing user privacy and control over shared information. [53, 78]

* **[[Screen Security]]** Options provided by messaging applications to prevent screenshots of conversations, enhancing privacy and security of communications. [53]

* **[[Local Message Storage]]** The practice of storing messages on users' devices rather than on central servers, which can enhance privacy by reducing the amount of data available to service providers. [53]

* **[[Encrypted Backups]]** A feature that secures cloud-based backups of chat history by encrypting them before they are stored on remote servers. This ensures that even the cloud service provider cannot access the content of the backups without the appropriate encryption keys. [53]

* **[[Data Minimization]]** A privacy-enhancing approach where applications collect and retain only the minimum amount of user data necessary for their operation. [[Signal]], for example, implements this principle by collecting very limited user data, primarily focusing on the phone number for account registration. [14]

* **[[Verified Sending]]** A concept in business messaging that serves as a crucial element for building consumer trust, ensuring that messages are authentically from the claimed sender. [23]

* **[[Rich Communication Services (RCS)]]** An enhanced messaging protocol intended to replace SMS, which has raised security concerns when not properly encrypted. Law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, have issued warnings about the vulnerabilities inherent in unencrypted messaging methods and the potential risks associated with RCS. [24, 25, 26]

* **[[Client-Server Encryption]]** Encryption that secures data between the user's device and the service provider's servers, but does not prevent the service provider from accessing the content. This is the default encryption model in many messaging platforms, including Telegram's regular chats. [72]
