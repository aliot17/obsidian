- **[[Secure Messaging Applications using Signal Protocol (or variants)]]** Messaging applications that implement the [[Signal Protocol]] or closely related protocols to provide end-to-end encrypted communication.
	* **[[Signal]]** A free and open-source secure messaging application known for its strong end-to-end encryption. It implements the [[Signal Protocol]] to provide end-to-end encryption for all forms of communication, including text messages, voice calls, and video calls. Signal collects very limited user data, primarily focusing on the phone number for account registration, and its open-source nature allows cybersecurity experts to review its code for vulnerabilities. [53, 14, 58]
	* **[[WhatsApp]]** A widely used messaging application that employs the [[Signal Protocol]] for end-to-end encryption in its private chats. While it provides  encryption for the content of communications, it collects a more extensive range of metadata compared to Signal, including information about users' contacts, usage patterns, and device identifiers. [49, 53, 8]
	* **[[Facebook Messenger (Secret Conversations)]]** An optional mode within [[Facebook Chat|Facebook Messenger]] that offers end-to-end encryption powered by the [[Signal Protocol]]. Like [[WhatsApp]], it collects a significant amount of user data and metadata. [48, 14]
	* **[[Skype]]** A communication platform that includes end-to-end encryption for private conversations using the [[Signal Protocol]].

* **[[Wire]]** A secure collaboration platform offering [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end encryption]], calls, and file sharing.

* **[[Silent Circle]]** A subscription-based secure communication service that uses its own proprietary Silent Circle Protocol for encryption.

* **[[Pond]]** A secure messaging application that prioritizes metadata privacy and uses [[Onion Routing + Message Padding (e.g., Tor)|Tor]] for anonymization.

* **[[Conversations (via OMEMO extension to XMPP)]]** An open-source Android [[XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)|XMPP]] client that supports the [[OMEMO (XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0384)|OMEMO]] extension for  [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end encryption]]

* **[[ChatSecure (via OMEMO extension to XMPP)]]** An open-source iOS [[XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol)|XMPP]] client that supports the [[OMEMO (XMPP Extension Protocol XEP-0384)|OMEMO]] extension for  [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end encryption]].

* **[[Google Messages]]** Google's default SMS and RCS messaging app, which has integrated [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|End-to-End Encryption]] for RCS chats based on the [[Signal Protocol]].

* **[[Apple iMessage]]** Apple's proprietary instant messaging service integrated into its devices. It provides [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|End-to-End Encryption]] for messages exchanged between Apple devices by default, but messages sent to non-Apple devices typically fall back to less secure SMS/MMS protocols. [75, 25]

* **[[Telegram]]** A popular messaging app that offers optional [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end encryption]] for "Secret Chats" but its default chats are cloud-based and encrypted server-to-client. It's a cloud-based messaging service, meaning that messages and media in regular chats are stored on its servers, allowing users to access them from multiple devices. This cloud-based storage model has been identified as a potential privacy risk, as the data is not protected by E2EE by default. [72]

* **[[Threema]]** A privacy-focused paid messaging app that encrypts all communication [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end]] and emphasizes data minimization. It allows users to create anonymous accounts without requiring a phone number, enhancing user privacy. [77, 79]

* **[[Keybase]]** A secure messaging and file-sharing application that uses public-key cryptography and provides key management and identity verification features.

* **[[Namecoin]]** A decentralized domain name system that can also be used for secure messaging and identity management by associating cryptographic keys with domain names on its blockchain.

* **[[Ricochet]]** A peer-to-peer instant messaging application designed for strong metadata privacy, using [[Onion Routing + Message Padding (e.g., Tor)|Tor]] hidden services for anonymous communication.

* **[[Email]]** An asynchronous, store-and-forward electronic mail system. While it can be secured with protocols like S/MIME or PGP, the base protocol does not offer end-to-end encryption or transport privacy by default.

* **[[Facebook Chat]]** The standard messaging feature within the Facebook platform, which uses transport layer security but does not offer default end-to-end encryption for all conversations.

* **[[Viber]]** A messaging application that offers [[End-to-End Encryption Protocols|end-to-end Encryption]] for one-to-one chats and calls but has faced scrutiny regarding its data collection practices. [12]

* **[[Element]]** A messaging client that uses the [[Matrix Protocol]], offering end-to-end encrypted communication through the Matrix network.
