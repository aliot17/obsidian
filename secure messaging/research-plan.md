# Secure Messaging Research Plan

## 1. Project Overview

Based on the MIR2 project document, this research will focus on developing secure and private messaging solutions that address current challenges in the field. The research will consider recent regulatory developments (such as the EU's Chat Control regulation), current technical standards, and innovative approaches to secure messaging.

## 2. Research Objectives

1. **Evaluate current secure messaging protocols and standards**
   - Analyze strengths and limitations of existing protocols (Signal, MLS, etc.)
   - Examine security properties (forward secrecy, post-compromise security)
   - Assess usability aspects and adoption challenges

2. **Investigate privacy-preserving techniques for messaging**
   - Study metadata protection mechanisms
   - Explore approaches for minimizing data exposure while maintaining functionality
   - Research techniques for secure group messaging

3. **Address regulatory compliance while maintaining privacy**
   - Analyze implications of regulations like EU's Chat Control
   - Develop approaches that can balance legal requirements with user privacy
   - Identify technical solutions for selective content scanning without compromising E2EE

4. **Design innovations in secure messaging architecture**
   - Explore decentralized messaging architectures
   - Investigate post-quantum secure messaging options
   - Research secure key management approaches for multiple devices

## 3. Methodology

1. **Literature Review**
   - Analyze academic papers from top security conferences (IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, PoPETS)
   - Review existing standards (IETF, NIST) for secure messaging
   - Examine technical documentation of popular secure messaging platforms

2. **Technical Analysis**
   - Benchmark performance of different encryption protocols
   - Evaluate security properties through formal verification
   - Assess vulnerability to various attack vectors

3. **Design and Prototyping**
   - Develop architectural models for improved secure messaging
   - Create prototype implementations of key components
   - Test innovations against security and privacy requirements

4. **Validation and Evaluation**
   - Security analysis through threat modeling
   - Usability testing with potential users
   - Performance benchmarking against existing solutions
