* **[[Quantum Computing Threats]]** The anticipated advancements in quantum computing that pose a potential threat to many of the current encryption algorithms underpinning secure messaging. Quantum computers, if sufficiently powerful, could potentially break widely used [[Public-Key Encryption]] methods, necessitating a transition to [[Post-Quantum Cryptography]]. [92]

* **[[AI in Messaging]]** The integration of Artificial Intelligence into messaging applications that presents both opportunities and significant privacy challenges. AI technologies have the capability to collect and analyze vast amounts of user data, including message content, usage patterns, and personal information, raising concerns about data privacy, security, and the potential for misuse. [161, 163, 170]

* **[[On-Device AI]]** AI capabilities that operate directly on user devices, which can present privacy risks as they may have access to sensitive information such as banking details or health records. Features like screen capture by on-device AI raise significant [[Message Privacy|privacy]] concerns. [164]

* **[[Group Messaging Security Challenges]]** The unique challenges presented by securing group messaging scenarios compared to one-on-one communications, particularly in managing keys and membership while maintaining efficiency and security guarantees. [18]

* **[[Third-Party Components Risk]]** The security risks introduced by the increasing complexity of messaging applications and their growing reliance on third-party components. Vulnerabilities in these components or their improper integration can create attack vectors that compromise the overall security of the application. [16]

* **[[Push Notification Metadata Leaks]]** The unintended exposure of sensitive metadata through [[Push Notification Services]] integrated into secure messaging applications. Research has shown that these services can leak data that could compromise user privacy. [16, 17]

* **[[Private Cloud Compute]]** A technology approach employed by companies like Apple to process sensitive data in the cloud while maintaining privacy. It aims to provide the benefits of cloud-based computing without exposing user data to the service provider. [190]
