### Analysis
- What kind of paper is it – can we tell from the abstract? 
	The abstract is one paragraph long, it has 1314 characters and 172 words. It is a systematic review paper, which is stated in the title and expanded in the abstract. 
- What is written in the abstract? 
	The abstract itself starts with postulating the problem of secure messaging and encryption in terms of forensic retrieving of evidence. It provides an short background for the main research vector from the position of law enforcement.  It then goes on to explaining the focus of the review, focusing on summarising the studies on "comprehensive understanding of artifact retrieval and forensic analysis trends" on popular secure messaging applications, with the examples being WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Wickr, and Threema. It ends with stating the significance of the findings and possible applications for different types of specialised readers, such as forensic investigators, cybersecurity practitioners, and users. The abstract is followed by the ACM Computing Classification System (CCS), advertising the concepts, used in the paper, as well as additional key words and phrases. 
- Do the expectations of the paper title match what is the real content? 
	The article contains a comprehensive analysis not only of literature, but also of protocols and encryption schemes of the five mentioned messengers. With it's impressive reference list of 149 items it matches and probably even exceeds the expectations. 
- How much is positioning/problem explanation? 
	Roughly a half of the abstract is dedicated to positioning and explanation of the problem. It provides the context, grounds for the initial topic of interest and a very condensed formulation of the research problem and focus.
- And how much is about what’s new/contribution in the paper? 
	Second half of the abstract explains what have been done. Since its a literature review, it doesnt focus that much on novelty, however it does provides an outline of what had been done and how it is useful for and can be applied by the different reader groups.
- How much existing/prior knowledge is needed to understand it? 
	The abstract doesn't contain any unexplained technical terms and is understandable for the general public, not familiar deeply with the topic.

### Analysis
- What kind of paper is it – can we tell from the abstract? 
	The abstract is one paragraph long, it has 1331 characters and 199 words. It looks like a full paper abstract. it list quite substantial amount of work, it has novel findings and description of discussion for the underlying reasons.
- Do the expectations of the paper title match what is the real content? 
	the article is quite extensive and appears as a thorough investigation with some useful findings and a clear message.  
- What is written in the abstract? 
	The abstract starts with two sentences explaining for the main round for the research being the usage of third party components by messaging apps to reduce engineering costs presenting a risk for a privacy breach. It then tells the exact platform and component that was investigated (Google’s Firebase Cloud Messaging service for Android's push notifications) and the number and source of selected for the research apps (21 popular secure messaging apps from the Google Play Store). It summarises the findings for those apps and how the found data leaks are not disclosed. It goes on with summarising of the found strategies, employed by the developers to mitigate the leaks and concludes with the main discussion argument for this state being economic and incentives problems of the platform and SDK providers.
	The abstract is followed by the list of key words.
- How much is positioning/problem explanation? 
	Positioning is explained in a very condensed but clear manner. Problem explanation done directly, with both the technological and logistical side. It even makes assumptions on the underlying principles for the current state of the art.
- And how much is about what’s new/contribution in the paper? 
	Half of the abstract is dedicated to the findings and discussion. It is clear, useful and direct.
- How much existing/prior knowledge is needed to understand it? 
	Some minimal technical knowledge on how apps and app platforms function is required (SDK).


## Paper 3: The Costs of Connectivity: WhatsApp Usage, Privacy Concerns, and Protection Behaviors in Israel
The Costs of Connectivity: WhatsApp Usage, Privacy Concerns, and Protection Behaviors in Israel \- Taylor & Francis Online, accessed April 23, 2025, [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08934215.2024.2424552?src=](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08934215.2024.2424552?src)

### Analysis
- What kind of paper is it – can we tell from the abstract? 
	The abstract is one paragraph long, it has 894 characters and 120 words. It looks like a full paper abstract. It lists a sample of 505 participants and claims some found correlations. However it also might as well be a short paper abstract.
- Do the expectations of the paper title match what is the real content? 
	The article title is employing some colourful language and gives a general topic overview. The article itself provides an overview of some core concepts, as well as an empirical study with the mixed results. The abstract focuses mainly on the empirical study which might seem slightly undermining for the theoretical focus of the paper. 
- What is written in the abstract? 
	The abstracts starts directly with the problem in focus. It lists the sample size and topics, continuing directly into the findings. It ends with the conclusion about the importance of understanding user behaviour and privacy perceptions for future research and policymaking. 
	The abstract is followed by the list of key words.
- How much is positioning/problem explanation? 
	Positioning is explained very shortly, not even in a full statement. The abstract rushes into explaining the empirical study setup and doesn't really provides the ground for the study
- And how much is about what’s new/contribution in the paper? 
	Most of the abstract is dedicated to the survey statistical outcomes and a very brief reasoning.
- How much existing/prior knowledge is needed to understand it? 
	No prior knowledge is needed to understand the paper, outside of the basic knowledge on statistics in the science.
